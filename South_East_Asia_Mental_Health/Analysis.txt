Look for similarities among the data that was clustered. 
Does it indicate anything interesting were any meaningful clusters found?

The cluster is set on a horizontal line going through a numerical nubmer of 1-10. 
Unfortunatly, for this dataset, a cluster is not much help is the data is not based on location. 
And although we do have a column for different countries and state, the outcome would be the same since the numirics are still 1-10.
